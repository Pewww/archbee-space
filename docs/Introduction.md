Our team has been hard at work listening to your feedback, and we implemented features that our users have been eagerly anticipating in our latest update (app version 3.31). Let's explore these enhancements in detail.\n\n## **Introducing customizable chat room names for an optimal and tailored chat experience**\n\n\n\n[block:image]\n{\n \"images\": [\n {\n \"image\": [\n \"https://files.readme.io/4ae0a5c-chat_names_EN.PNG\",\n null,\n \"\"\n ],\n \"align\": \"center\",\n \"sizing\": \"600px\"\n }\n ]\n}\n[/block]\n\nOne of the highly anticipated updates is the chat room naming feature. Users now have the ability to customize and manage the names of their 1-on-1 or group chats. This empowers users to personalize their chat rooms to align with their hobbies, interests, or social groups. The result is a more efficient, diverse, and personalized chat experience.\n\n## **Unsend with ease and take control of your chat conversations**\n\n![](https://files.readme.io/b0f27a2-unsend_EN.PNG)\n\nAnother game-changing update to our chat feature is the option to “unsend” messages. Users now have the power to cancel message submissions and delete messages from both the recipient and sender's inbox. Say goodbye to those accidental typos, embarrassing moments, or messages sent to the wrong person.\n\n## **Welcoming new users with handpicked content recommendations**\n\n[block:image]\n{\n \"images\": [\n {\n \"image\": [\n \"https://files.readme.io/3867623-us_favorite.png\",\n null,\n \"\"\n ],\n \"align\": \"center\",\n \"sizing\": \"300px\"\n }\n ]\n}\n[/block]\n\nAre you a new user looking for an instant dose of excitement on ZEPETO? We've got you covered! \nNew users can now enjoy curated content directly in their chats, handpicked by our content team. We want our community to experience the absolute best content that ZEPETO has to offer right from the start and we're confident these recommendations will make the ZEPETO experience even better!\n\n## **Growing together with our community**\n\nAt ZEPETO, we believe in constant growth and improvement, and our community’s feedback plays a pivotal role in shaping our platform. Our product team eagerly listens to valuable user feedback, leveraging cutting-edge analytics and data insights to fuel our decision-making process. Through user interviews and careful analysis, we have implemented over 60 major VOC (Voice of Customer) improvements across all ZEPETO features, including chat. \nIn 2022, these 60+ VOC (Voice of Customer) upgrades across all ZEPETO features resulted in a 32% (6pp) increase in chat usage since January and a remarkable 53% surge in messages sent per user.\n\nWe will continue to innovate and respond to user needs, delivering exciting updates and features that keep our community engaged, entertained, and connected. Thank you.\n\n**By Wonjin Lee, Community PM**
